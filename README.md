# Smart Classroom System

This is a University Project by Team 18 of NIIT University that aims to create a smart classroom environment wherein:

1. It turns on light when it detects a person in a class until he/she is gone.
2. Switches fan on and off according to the temperature and humidity.

This website compliments the project by showing the data coming from the sensors through thingspeak cloud.
